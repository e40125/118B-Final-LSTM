# COGS-118B-Final-Project-Code
Project Title: Stock Market Trend Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks
Brief Description: As part of a team project for COGS 118B, we developed and compared various machine learning models to predict stock market trends, specifically forecasting the closing price of the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) for December 8, 2021. My focus was on implementing and optimizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for this time series forecasting task.
My Role:
Developed and implemented the LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras
Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering
Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
Analyzed model results and compared them with other team members' models
Presented final project
Key Skills Demonstrated:
Python (TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
Time series analysis and forecasting
Deep Learning: Implementation of LSTM neural networks
Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial time series
Hyperparameter tuning for neural networks
Outcomes and Results:
Successfully implemented an LSTM model on predicting next-day stock prices
Prediction of closing price data on 12/8/2021 off by $21.48
Model trained on all historical data achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.30%
Compared LSTM performance with ARIMA, Brownian motion with drift, and Linear Regression
Improved skills in collaborative research, data preprocessing, model implementation, and result analysis
